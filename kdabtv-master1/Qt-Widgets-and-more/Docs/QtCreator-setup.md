# Re-setting up Qt Creator
QWAM has many different setup tips for Qt Creator. This document collect steps for re-setting up a new Qt Creator - as some of the things need to be re-setup for each new installation.

## Setup the spell checker

These are usually the steps:

1. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/CJCombrink/SpellChecker-Plugin)
    * Take it from the *Releases* section, and check it matches your Qt Creator version
2. Copy the files to $QTDIR/Tools/QtCreator/
3. Restart Qt Creator, and check it appears in Help->About Plugins



## Setup the fonts - Jetbrains Mono

1. [go to website](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
2. Click the Download font
3. Click _How to install_ at the top and follow the steps
4. In Qt Creator, choose Tools->Options->TextEditor->Font & Colors
5. Choose JetBrains Mono



## Install your document templates

Likely in your source directory locate the install script, which will copy files over. [It might look like this one](https://github.com/KDAB/kdabtv/blob/master/Qt-Widgets-and-more/QtCreatorFileTemplates/install)



## Install your Qt Designer plugins

This likely requires no more than you compiling your source code, as the episode told you how to setup CMake for it to automatically install it.

There might be a chance you need to configure it in CMake though.



## Setup CPPreference in Qt Creator
[QWAM episode - Adding CPPreference to Qt Creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ELbrOdRM2c&list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&index=32)

1. [Download the help bool](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives)
2. Go to Tools -> Options -> Help -> Documentation
3. Press Add, and choose the downloaded file.

## Ensuring your are setup with clang, ninja and ccache
[QWAM episode - Speeding Up Compilation Using CCache, Ninja and Clang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKedzwAWBC0&list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&index=33)

1. Check which kit you are using: **Tools** sidebar, check section **Build & Run**. Active kits are the ones _not_ grayed out.
2. Check your kit is correct: Tools -> Options -> Kits
    * Check C and C++ compiler points to something like:
    > **Clang** (C++, x86, 64bit in /usr/lib/**ccache**)
    * Check your CMake generator is set to **Ninja**
    
    

    
## Install Debugging Helpers
[QWAM episode - Writing Qt Creator Debugging Helpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgBBT7aUNco&list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&index=39)

You need to copy the .py file to the subdir share/qtcreator/debugger inside your qt creator sources.
If you haven't set up an install script yet, it might make sense to do so, have a look at [this file for inspiration](https://github.com/KDAB/kdabtv/blob/master/Qt-Widgets-and-more/debuggingHelper/install.sh)
    

   
## Setup external commands for running rr
[QWAM episode - Reverse Debugging Using rr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uYsZEAQiLM&list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&index=37)

In this episode we created an [external command](https://youtu.be/0uYsZEAQiLM?list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&t=633) to start recording.
Observe since the recording the variable for current binary exist again, so instead of your binaries path, add 
> %{ActiveProject:RunConfig:Executable:FilePath}

We also [configured the connection to an external debug server](https://youtu.be/0uYsZEAQiLM?list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&t=925).


## Setup external command for launching GammaRay
[QWAM episode - Starting the Application in GammaRay from Qt Creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LAINPOB19E&list=PL6CJYn40gN6gf-G-o6syFwGrtq3kItEqI&index=8)

Add the external command and the keybinding for it.
